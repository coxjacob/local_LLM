Notes from my LLM:
T5 (Text-to-Text Transfer Transformer): T5 is a transformer-based 
architecture developed by Google AI that can be used for various 
natural language processing tasks, including summarization. It can 
be applied to summarize the content in a directory of files by 
training it on a large dataset of document summaries. For example, 
you can use T5 to summarize a set of academic papers, creating a 
summary document that condenses the key findings and conclusions 
from all the original papers.
