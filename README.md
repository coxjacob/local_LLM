## Notes from my LLM:
T5 (Text-to-Text Transfer Transformer): T5 is a transformer-based architecture developed by Google AI that can be used for various natural language processing tasks, including summarization. It can be applied to summarize the content in a directory of files by training it on a large dataset of document summaries. For example, you can use T5 to summarize a set of academic papers, creating a summary document that condenses the key findings and conclusions 
from all the original papers.
